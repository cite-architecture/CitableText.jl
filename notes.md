Some functions defined in the Scala library ([API docs](https://cite-architecture.github.io/cite-api-docs/xcite/api/edu/holycross/shot/cite/CtsUrn.html)) that could be implemented here:

- adding/dropping a passage component
- adding/dropping a version
- adding/dropping an exemplar
- finding citation depth
- collapsing passage to a given depth or by a relative amount

URN comparison:

- <, >, equality, <=, >=
- URN similarity (twiddling/negate twiddling )
